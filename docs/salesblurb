<h2>GPS FlightMaster 5.0</h2> 


<p>FlightMaster is a GPS moving map and navigation aid for pilots. Its four
moving map pages display waypoints, navaids, obstacles, airspace and airways.
They can be oriented track or north up, and with or without heading arc.</p>

<p>All of this detail is configurable by only a few taps on the screen. Each
map has its own settings - so you can have one map setup for IFR, one for
approach, one for enroute etc. And with FlightMaster's drag-and-pan and
built-in flight plan editor you can easily change your flight plan
en-route.</p>

<p>FlightMaster also features other  clear and intuitive navigation displays,
including HSI, Flight Plan and Proximity Waypoints and it integrates with
CoPilot v5 (by Laurie Davis). A GPS-driven Attitude Approximator is included
that could prove invaluable in the event of loss of primary attitude
indication.</p>

<p>FlightMaster supports serial, slot-in card and Bluetooth GPS devices that
use NMEA output. FlightMaster supports high-density colour displays.</p>
