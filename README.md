# PalmOS and Haskell implementations of FlightMaster

I seriously doubt anyone would want to revive either of these projects, but at least they are here for
historical interest  (if anyone cares).   

If you want to build any of these you're on your own - I have no more information
in my archives and it's been so long since I touched any of them I wouldn't know where to start to help.

## PalmOS

Source in the 'c' folder. Represents version 7.7 (which was never actually released, the latest release was v7.6).

## Haskell

An aborted attempt to port FlightMaster to Windows and Linux. About 18 months work, on and off, and nearly killed me. 
Haskell is a really solid language though, I just don't think I was in the right place to try and pull this off.

## Utils

Various utilities to create airspace, waypoint and terrain files.
