The Units setting controls which units (Nm=Nautical, Mi=Statute Miles, Km=Kilometers) you want to display on the navigation screen. You may use the units you have specified within the Flight Planner.

The Headings setting controls display of True or Magnetic bearings & headings. Compass bearings (e.g. FROM = S S E) are ALWAYS relative to true north.

Source allows you to specify what sort of GPS you are using - most work with Cradle, but some may require the Serial setting. Restart the GPS from the GPS screen for the change to take effect.

Select GPS jitter correction if you are sure that your GPS is sending data at one-second intervals, but you are experiencing jitter on the VSI & AA (useful for older GPS receivers and FS2002/2004).

Select the Auto-start GPS checkbox to start the GPS on application launch.
